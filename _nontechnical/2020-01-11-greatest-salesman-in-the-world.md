One of the books that I read on the first week of this year was <i>The Greatest Salesman in the World</i> by Og Mandino. Basically, the primary content is about the fundamental principles in being a great salesman.

In this post, I'm going to write down an immensely brief summary of those principles wrapped in form of scrolls. The first scroll forms a pre-requisite, while the rests are the main principles.

**Scroll Marked I**

The secret of learning. This scroll acts as the first principle that must be understood before proceeding to the next ones.

Building a good habit becomes the core point. A habit of reading every day, precisely. There's a provision where every scroll must be read in certain times and amount of reading. Such a provision is required before starting the next chapter of the principles.

**Scroll Marked II**

Greet the days with love in heart. In other words, see things positively or always strive to look for positive things in everything happens in a day. Be positive.

**Scroll Marked III**

Persistence. Never give up. Failures will carry the seed of tomorrow's good luck.

**Scroll Marked IV**

Every person is unique. None has the ability to sell exactly as you. Henceforth, you will capitalize on this difference for it is an asset to be promoted to the fullest.

**Scroll Marked V**

Live this day as if it is your last. Forgetting yesterday and don't think of tomorrow. Today should be your greatest moment. Make the most of today.

**Scroll Marked VI**

Be master of your emotions. If you bring joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter to your customers, they will react with joy and enthusiasm and brightness and laughter and your weather will produce a harvest of sales and a granary of gold for you.

How would you master your emotions so that every day is a happy day and a productive one? Learn this secret of the ages: <i>"Weak is he who permits his thoughts to control his actions; strong is he who forces his actions to control his thoughts"</i>.

By mastering your emotions, you will be prepared to control whatever personality you encounter.

**Scroll Marked VII**

Patience. Know that not everything can be controlled.

**Scroll Marked VIII**

Better version of yourself every day. Raise your goal as soon as they are attained.

**Scroll Marked IX**

Act now. Do not procrastinate. If you can do it today, don't wait for tomorrow for tomorrow might not come.

**Scroll Marked X**

Pray for <b>guidance</b> so that you can achieve your goals. Never pray for material things in this world.

Here's the prayer as a salesman.

<i>Oh Creator of All Things, help me. For this day I go out into the world naked and alone, and without Your hand to guide me I will wander far from the path which leads to success and happiness.
<br/><br/>
I ask not for gold or garments or even opportunities equal to my ability; instead, guide me so that I may acquire ability equal to my opportunities.
<br/><br/>
You have taught the lion and the eagle how to hunt and prosper with teeth and claw. Teach me how to hunt with words and prosper with love so that I may be a lion among men and an eagle in the market place.
<br/><br/>
Help me to remain humble through obstacles and failures; yet hide not from mine eyes the prize that will come with victory.
<br/><br/>
Assign me with tasks to which others have failed; yet guide me to pluck the seeds of success from their failures. Confront me with fears that will temper my spirit; yet endow me with courage to laugh at my misgivings.
<br/><br/>
Spare me sufficient days to reach my goals; yet help me to live this day as though it be my last.
<br/><br/>
Guide me in my words that they may bear fruit; yet silence me from gossip that none be maligned.
<br/><br/>
Discipline me in the habit of trying and trying again; yet show me the way to make use of the law of averages. Favor me with alertness to recognize opportunity; yet endow me with patience which will concentrate my strength.
<br/><br/>
Bathe me in good habits that the bed ones may drown; yet grant me compassion for weaknesses in others. Suffer me to know that all things shall pas; yet help me to count my blessings of today.
<br/><br/>
Expose me to hate so it not be a stranger; yet fill my cup with love to turn strangers into friends.
<br/><br/>
But all these things be only if Thy will. I am a small and a lonely grape clutching the vine yet Thou hast made me different from all others. Verily, there must be a special place for me. Guide me. Help me. Show me the way.
<br/><br/>
Let me become all You planned for me when my seed was planted and selected by You to sprout in the vineyard of the world.
<br/><br/>
Help this humble salesman.<br/><br/>
Guide me, God.
</i>
