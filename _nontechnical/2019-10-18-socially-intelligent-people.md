I read an interesting article titled <a href="https://psiloveyou.xyz/5-actions-socially-intelligent-people-take-595b1670b1b4">5 Things Socially Intelligent People Consistently Do</a> written by Michael Thompson.

Here's a quick summary of the article.

My mom got it dead right, “Nothing compounds faster than kindness.”

Socially intelligent people:

<ol>
<li>
  <b>Share their network.</b> When someone is explaining a problem, <i>introduce the people in their network who have faced the similar situation.</i>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Withhold judgment.</b> Whether it's someone holding the door, sharing the elevator, or serving them coffee, they acknowledge them and show them respect. Put down your phone and lift up your head. Make a smile and say hello to each person you pass. Most people today are so busy worrying about themselves & they failed to realize that the <i>secret to happiness is standing in front of them.</i>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Listen more than speak.</b> Give the person they're speaking with the full presence. <i>They ask questions that bring out the best in others.</i>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Consider every interaction as a learning opportunity.</b> Meeting new people means new perspective, thoughts, and feelings. <i>Continuously learning.</i>
</li>
<li>
  <b>Give for the sake of giving.</b> When they have the opportunity to do nice things for someone, they <i>don't hesitate & don't think about potential ways they can benefit from it.</i>
</li>
</ol>
