To explain it simply, Johari Window is a diagram showing relationships between a person and others.

Below is the Johari Window.

As you can see, the diagram is divided into four areas:

<ul>
<li><b>Arena</b><br/>
Describes all things that both parties know
</li>
<li><b>Blind</b><br/>
Describes all things that others know something that you are not aware of
</li>
<li><b>Hidden</b><br/>
Describes all things that only you know. Probably those things are private and you don’t want to disclose them to public
</li>
<li><b>Unknown</b><br/>
Describes all things that others don’t know and you are not aware of
</li>
</ul>

Interestingly, we could enlarge the <b>Arena</b> quadrant by doing the followings.

<ul>
<li><b>Decrease the Blind Area</b><br/>
We need to request for feedbacks from others
</li>
<li><b>Decrease the Unknown Area</b><br/>
We need to share our discoveries to others
</li>
<li><b>Decrease the Hidden Area</b><br/>
We need to choose whether we want to disclose certain information to public (self-disclosure)
</li>
<li><b>From Unknown to Hidden</b><br/>
We need to discover all the hidden aspects within ourselves (self-discovery)
</li>
</ul>
