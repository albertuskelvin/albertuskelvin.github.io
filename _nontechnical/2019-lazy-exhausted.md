Taking a break is sometimes considered as lazy behaviour by our today’s society.

The point is don’t simply judge people for being lazy. Let’s take a look at several differences (simplified) between laziness and exhaustion.

<b>LAZY</b>

<ul>
<li>Have the energy to get something done if they want to</li>
<li>Lack of discipline to do something that requires great effort</li>
<li>Solution: take action</li>
</ul>

<b>EXHAUSTED</b>

<ul>
<li>Lack of energy to get something done</li>
<li>Have the discipline to do something even though it requires great effort</li>
<li>Solution: take a break</li>
</ul>

However, people in each category sometimes misinterpret the solution. Lazy people sometimes just lazy to do anything and fool themselves by presuming that they **need a break** (which is the solution for exhausted people). The problem is that this only **prolongs their laziness**.

On the other hand, exhausted people sometimes feel guilty that they don’t be productive and spend their time doing meaningless stuffs. Because of this, they decide to **take action** (which is the solution for lazy people) for the sake of getting more done. This is actually wrong since this might **cause more energy drain**.

Therefore, I think it’s important for us to know exactly what our category is. Knowing so we would be able to take the relevant solution (take action or take a break). Additionally, people who have done some work really need a break and it shouldn’t be presumed as a guilt. This mindset should also be owned by today’s society as it supports people to take the right action.
